perf: optimize heavy computation in Dashboard component

- Move billion-iteration computation to Web Worker
- Add chunked fallback implementation using requestAnimationFrame
- Prevent main thread blocking during calculation
- Add loading state indicator for better UX

Description:
## Performance Optimization for Dashboard Component

### Problem
The Dashboard component was performing a heavy computation (summing 1 billion numbers) directly on the main thread, resulting in:
- High Total Blocking Time (TBT) in Lighthouse metrics
- Poor user experience due to UI freezing
- Unresponsive page during calculation

### Solution
Implemented two approaches to resolve the performance bottleneck:

1. **Primary Solution: Web Worker Implementation**
   - Moved computation to a dedicated Web Worker thread
   - Main thread remains responsive for user interactions
   - Clean worker cleanup on component unmount
   - Zero impact on TBT metric

2. **Fallback Solution: Chunked Computation**
   - Alternative implementation using `requestAnimationFrame`
   - Breaks computation into 1M number chunks
   - Allows UI updates between chunks
   - Significantly reduced TBT compared to original

### Technical Details
- Created new `calculator.worker.ts` for isolated computation
- Implemented proper worker lifecycle management
- Added loading state indicator for better UX
- Maintained type safety with TypeScript

### Testing
Please verify:
- [ ] Dashboard loads without UI freezing
- [ ] Computation completes successfully
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score improvement
- [ ] Works across different browsers

### Lighthouse Impact
- Before: High TBT due to main thread blocking
- After: Minimal TBT with Web Worker solution
